# Wine Quality Data Analysis â€“ EDA Project

This project explores the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning**, and **visual insights** into the physicochemical factors that influence wine quality. The goal is to uncover trends and relationships in the dataset to better understand what makes a wine high or low quality.
